## P0 — Must Do Tomorrow
- [ ] Restart nanoclaw from `/Dev/nanoclaw-private` on branch `sansan-private` (sasusan non-responsive in Discord — running from wrong/old codebase)
- [ ] Identify and fix the sansan bug (unconfirmed — likely infinite replay or env issue from running public nanoclaw without cherry-picks)

## P1 — This Week
- [ ] Wire sasusan/shadow-tower as spidersan conflict alert recipient in `conflicts.ts notifyHub()`
- [ ] Add spidersan pre-commit hook to treesync `src/transport/git.ts` — run `spidersan conflicts` before `autoCommit()`
- [ ] IPC trigger: sansan writes to `/workspace/ipc/sync-trigger` → host runs `sync.sh` on demand
- [ ] Trace toak collab → treebird-internal sync chain (toak writes to `/Dev/toak/collab/` but treesync picks up `/Dev/treebird-internal/` — unclear if connected)

## P2 — Future
- [ ] `spidersan --escalate` flag: ping control tower agent on TIER 2+ conflicts
- [ ] treesync on-demand mode (in addition to auto-watch)
- [ ] Retire `/Dev/skills/` (lowercase) — `/Dev/Skills` is now canonical

## Key Context
- nanoclaw remote topology: `origin`=gavrielc/nanoclaw, `fork`=treebird7/nanoclaw, `private`=treebird7/nanoclaw-private
- All 11 cherry-picks are on `treebird7/nanoclaw-private:sansan-private` — this is what should run
- spidersan v0.4.5 published, GitHub release created
- `/Dev/Skills` is canonical skills repo (git-tracked, `treebird7/skills.git`)
- sansan-knowledge sync daemon STOPPED (was hourly rsync --delete) — run sync.sh manually

## Files to Check
- `/Dev/nanoclaw/src/container-runner.ts` — has envoak/env-dir mount + readSecrets()
- `/Dev/nanoclaw/src/index.ts` — has previousCursor + outputSentToUser (replay fix)
- `/Dev/treebird-internal/treesync/src/transport/git.ts` — where spidersan hook should go
- `/Dev/spidersan-oss/src/commands/conflicts.ts:94` — notifyHub(), add sasusan as recipient
