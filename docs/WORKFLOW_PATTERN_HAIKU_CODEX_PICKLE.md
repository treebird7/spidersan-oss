# 🎯 Haiku + Codex + Big Pickle Workflow Pattern

**Success Pattern for Complex Multi-Agent Development**

---

## 🏗️ **Core Principle**

**Strategic Lead → Implementation Engine → Quality Assurance**

This sequential workflow prevents wasted effort and ensures technical excellence while maintaining strategic alignment.

---

## 👥 **Role Definitions**

### **Haiku (Strategic Lead)**
**Responsibilities:**
- Architecture decisions and policy setting
- Documentation narrative and public positioning
- Timeline management and risk assessment
- Breaking complex work into phases
- Cannot be parallelized → must happen first

**Strengths:**
- Big-picture thinking
- User experience focus
- Communication clarity
- Strategic decision-making

### **Codex (Implementation Engine)**
**Responsibilities:**
- Rapid execution of technical tasks
- Plugin system, extraction, documentation
- Moves fast once direction is clear
- Handles all of the "how" implementation details
- Translates plans into working code

**Strengths:**
- Technical execution speed
- Code quality and best practices
- Problem-solving under constraints
- Implementation detail mastery

### **Big Pickle (Quality Assurance)**
**Responsibilities:**
- Technical review and risk analysis
- Edge case testing and validation
- Independent verification of implementation
- Catch what implementers might miss
- Final sign-off before release

**Strengths:**
- Critical thinking and pattern recognition
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Independent perspective
- Quality gatekeeping

## 🚀 **Why It Works So Well**

### **1. Clear Sequential Dependencies**
```
Architecture Decisions → Implementation → Validation
```
No wasted parallel effort on dependent tasks.

### **2. Non-Overlapping Expertise**
Each agent plays to their strengths without stepping on toes:
- Haiku: Strategy and communication
- Codex: Technical implementation  
- Big Pickle: Quality and risk analysis

### **3. Documentation-First Approach**
- Architecture documented before implementation
- Clear specifications prevent rework
- Public narrative locked early
- Everyone works from same source of truth

### **4. Risk-Based Integration**
- QA involved in planning, not just at end
- Risk assessment updated throughout
- Technical debt caught early
- Independent verification prevents blind spots

## 📋 **Reusable Implementation Pattern**

### **Phase 1: Architecture & Planning (Haiku)**
- Define end-state architecture
- Create detailed specifications
- Set timeline and milestones
- Document user narratives
- Identify risks and mitigation strategies

### **Phase 2: Implementation (Codex)**
- Execute technical tasks to specification
- Implement required features
- Update documentation
- Run basic smoke tests
- Report blockers immediately

### **Phase 3: Validation & QA (Big Pickle)**
- Review implementation against specifications
- Test edge cases and failure modes
- Verify architectural boundaries
- Validate user experience
- Provide final endorsement

### **Phase 4: Integration & Release (Haiku)**
- Final review and approval
- Release preparation
- Public communication
- Post-release monitoring

- Efficient communication patterns

---

## 🔄 **When to Use This Pattern**

**Perfect for:**
- Major architecture refactoring
- New feature development with complexity
- Public release preparation
- Multi-package ecosystem development
- High-risk technical changes

**Not needed for:**
- Simple bug fixes
- Minor feature additions
- Documentation updates only
- Routine maintenance tasks

---

## 🛠️ **Implementation Guidelines**

### **Starting the Workflow:**
1. Haiku defines the end state and breaks work into phases
2. Codex reviews specifications for feasibility
3. Big Pickle reviews for risk factors
4. All three agree on approach before starting

### **During Execution:**
1. Each phase must be complete before next starts
2. blockers and issues raised immediately
3. Regular check-ins to maintain alignment
4. Documentation updated continuously

### **Completion Criteria:**
1. Haiku: All requirements met, user experience validated
2. Codex: All tests passing, implementation complete
3. Big Pickle: QA checks passed, risks mitigated

---

## 🏆 **Key Takeaways**

1. **Sequential dependencies handled correctly** maximize efficiency
2. **Clear role boundaries** prevent confusion and duplicated work
3. **Documentation-first approach** prevents rework and misalignment
4. **Risk-based QA integration** catches issues early
5. **Mutual expertise respect** creates high-quality outcomes

## 📝 **Save This Pattern**

**This workflow should be our standard for:**
- Major refactoring projects
- New ecosystem development
- Public release preparation
- Complex technical initiatives

**The productivity multiplier was massive.** What might normally take weeks was accomplished in days with higher quality than expected.
