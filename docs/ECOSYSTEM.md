# Spidersan Ecosystem (Internal)

Spidersan Core is the public, MIT-licensed CLI. The Ecosystem plugin adds advanced coordination features and is currently internal to Treebird.

## What It Adds

- Symbol locking and semantic analysis
- Intent scanning and active-window detection
- Real-time monitoring dashboards
- Messaging and multi-repo sync
- Security pipeline + MCP health tools

## Availability

The ecosystem lives in `treebird-internal/spidersan-ecosystem` for now. It will be published when the ecosystem is ready for public use.
